        Eve measures the qubits in her chosen bases for the intercepted qubits.
        For qubits Eve does not intercept, just pass them through as |0> (no operation).
        However, in a realistic scenario, if Eve is not intercepting, she wouldn't measure at all.
        We'll assume that if Eve doesn't intercept a qubit, it just passes through unchanged.
        
        Implementation detail:
        - To simulate the intercept-resend, we need to measure all qubits.
        - For non-intercepted qubits, Eve does not know the state and does not measure them;
          but for simplicity here, we will measure all qubits. If a qubit is "not intercepted,"
          we can just say Eve measured in the Z-basis without altering it. Alternatively,
          we can separate intercepted from non-intercepted qubits, but that complicates logic.
          
        Let's simplify:
        - If Eve doesn't intercept a qubit, we just measure it in the Z-basis 
          and consider that Eve 'passes it along' unchanged (though in a real scenario 
          not intercepting means not touching it at all. This simplification still shows 
          differences in the final key).
          
        In a more realistic model, you wouldn't measure qubits Eve does not intercept.
        For demonstration, we just proceed uniformly to have a workable example.
